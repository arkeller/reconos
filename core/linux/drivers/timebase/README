ReconOS/Linux DCR timebase kernel driver
========================================

OVERVIEW AND USAGE

This driver provides an interface for accessing the dcr_timebase core used
for accurate inter-thread timing measurements in ReconOS. It supports reading
of 32 bit values only. To retrieve the current time base value from the
dcr_timebase core, just read() 32 bits from it. I'm not sure about endianess. :)

NOTE: The timebase value is stored in the DCR register with offset 1 to the
DCR baseaddress. The register at offset 0 is reserved as a control register.
It has no purpose for now.

MODULE OPTIONS

The module takes a number of option which can be passed to the insmod command:

    timebase_major  The major number to register the character device with.
                    If not specified, a major number is dynamically allocated
                    by the kernel. It can be read using /proc or sysfs.

    timebase_baseaddr 
                    The base addresses to be used for the dcr_timebase
                    reads.
                    Note: If the DCR is directly attached to the CPU, this
                    address is a raw DCR address, with a spacing of 1
                    between the individual registers. If a opb2dcr bridge is
                    used, this address is an OPB address, with a spacing
                    of 4 between the registers.

    use_opb2dcr     Explicitly tell the driver to use memory mapped bus 
                    transactions when talking to the DCR bus.
