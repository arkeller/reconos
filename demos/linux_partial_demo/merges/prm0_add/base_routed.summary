Validation Process Summary Report.


The purpose of the validation script is to generate all of the 
bit stream files required by the user input and to validate that 
the reconfiguration module bit streams are truly writing all of the 
bit frames necessary to successfully reconfigure the part.
This report also generates information about all files generated
and will inform the user of any errors that occur.


FILE INFORMATION.
