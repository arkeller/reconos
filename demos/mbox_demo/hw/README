----------------------

This directory contains all necessary files to generate the static EDK design
for the "mbox" example application. 

    - Run 'setup.sh' to set up and build the design in the 'edk-static'
      directory, as well as the libraries. The resulting bitstream
      'system.bit'will be located in the edk-static/implementation directory.
    - Use iMPACT to download the bitstream to the FPGA, and continue with the
      software part (see ../sw/README).

Make sure that your environment for ReconOS is set correctly, especially
the HW_DESIGN variable. 
See http://www.reconos.de/twiki/bin/view/ReconOS/SetupEnvironment for details.
