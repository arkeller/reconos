----------------------

This directory contains all necessary files to generate the software libraries
and executables for the "mbox" example application. Be sure to build the
hardware part first. See ../hw/README for details on how to do that.

When the hardware part is built, make sure your environment is set correctly,
especially the HW_DESIGN variable (it needs to be set to the absolute path
to the ../hw/edk-static directory).
See http://www.reconos.de/twiki/bin/view/ReconOS/SetupEnvironment for details.

    - Run 'make setup' to build the eCos library.
    - Run 'make ecos' to build the executables for the ReconOS system.
    - Use the XMD to upload the executables to the XUP board.
    
The application executable is named 'mbox_demo.elf'. The application can be 
configured through #defines at the top of 'mbox_demo.c' to enable/disable
cache, and use hardware or software FIFOs.
