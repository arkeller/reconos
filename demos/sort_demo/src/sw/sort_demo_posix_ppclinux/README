PetaLinux User Application Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux user application created from a template.

If you are developing your application from scratch, simply start editing the
file sort_demo_posix.c.

You can easily import any existing application code by copying it into this 
directory, and editing the automatically generated Makefile as described below.

To build your application, simply run the "make" command in this directory.

To copy your application binary into your Embedded Linux root filesystem, run
"make romfs" from this directory.  It will be copied into the directory
   - petalinux/software/petalinux-dist/romfs/bin

From there, when you run  "make image" (or simply "make"), in the petalinux-dist directory, it will be copied into the downloadable kernel and linux image.

There are several useful and easy customisations that you can perform on this
template application.  

To add extra source code files (for example, to split a large application into 
multiple source files), add the relevant .o files to the list in the local 
Makefile where indicated.  

To have other files (for example application configuration files or scripts) 
copied into the root file system, add addition lines under the "romfs: target in
the Makefile.  For example

$(ROMFSINST) myfile.conf /etc

	Copy the file myfile.conf from this directory into the /etc directory
	on the Embedded Linux filesystem)


$(ROMFSINST) -a -a "some text here" /etc/system.conf
	
	Add the line "some text here" to the /etc/system.conf file.

See petalinux-dist/tools/romfsinst.sh for details and more options.
