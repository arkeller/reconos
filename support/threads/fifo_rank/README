hwt_fifo_rank.vhd

implements an 3x3 rank filter which can be configured at runtime. init_data can be used to configure the
behaviour of the thread:

     #bit: 31  30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 ...  4   3  2  1  0
init_data:  i  m6 m5 m4 m3 m2 m1 m0  X  X  X ...  X  r3 r2 r1 r0

      i : invert bit
m0 to m6: mode ( 0x02   -> median
                 0x04   -> red to grayscale
                 0x08   -> green to grayscale
                 0x10   -> blue to grayscale
                 others -> passthrough (output = input) )
r3 to r0: rank of the output pixel (0 to 8)
      X : don't care

where bit31 is the most significant bit.

The thread expects to receive the input pixel data from mailbox 0x00000000 and writes out pixel data to
mailbox 0x00000001. The pixel format should be X"00" & channel2 & channel1 & channel0 (1 pixel = 32 bits, msb
is ignored).

The thread needs to be reset after each frame. This is a feature.
