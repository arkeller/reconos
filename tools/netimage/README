This directory contains the 'netimage' tools for the ReconOS project.
They include tools to send and receive image data (still images and
video) over TCP/IP connections. The 'netimage' tools are written to
facilitate transfer of image data to and from an embedded system
running eCos/ReconOS.

The main tools are:

    sendvideo	transmits video data from a file or a camera
    recvvideo	receives video data
    sendimage	transmits still data from a file
    recvimage	receives video data
    
All tools are capable of saving received (and in sendvideo's case,
also transmitted) data to disk for later analysis.
